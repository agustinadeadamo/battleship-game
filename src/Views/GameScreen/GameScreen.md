# StartScreen view
This view is shows once the username was added and the ship's position has been selected. 
After each onclick in user grid it generates an onclick in computer game to simulate other player.
A pop up is shown with each notification, even if the shot has been missed.
Once all the ships where destroyed in one of the grids it redirects to the EndGame screen.
