### Comments:
There are three things that i would like to have more time to work on it. First of all i would like to add a handle error so as in case something fails in the app it shows a message error, more friendly to the user. In the second place I would like to finish with the test on the GameScreen view, and as a last item I would improve user experience, specially for mobile devices.
